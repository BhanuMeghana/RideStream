1.Create a Maven Project

Use your IDE or command line to generate a Maven project.
Set up the directory structure as described.
Add Dependencies

Configure pom.xml with necessary dependencies:
Spring Boot
MySQL
Tomcat
JUnit
Mockito
Spring Security
Other required libraries
Create Project Structure

Organize directories for source code (src/main/java), resources (src/main/resources), and tests (src/test/java).
2. Develop the Application
Define Models

Create Java classes for entities like Shuttle, Reservation, User, etc.
Implement Repositories

Create interfaces extending JpaRepository for CRUD operations.
Develop Services

Write service classes for business logic.
Create Controllers

Implement REST controllers for API endpoints.
Configure Security

Set up Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Add Configuration Files

Configure application properties in application.properties or application.yml.
3. Testing
Write Unit Tests

Use JUnit and Mockito to write unit tests for services and controllers.
Place tests in src/test/java.
Perform Integration Testing

Write integration tests to verify that various components work together.
Use Spring Boot’s testing framework.
Place tests in src/test/java.
4. Build the Application
Build the Project
Use Maven commands:
mvn clean install to compile and package the application.
Ensure the WAR file is generated in the target directory.
5. Prepare for Deployment
Prepare AWS EC2

Launch an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu.
Configure security groups to allow necessary ports (22, 80, 8080).
Install Required Software

Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH.
Install Java, MySQL, and Tomcat.
Transfer and Deploy

Upload the WAR file to the EC2 instance.
Place the WAR file in Tomcat’s webapps directory.
Start Tomcat and ensure the application is running.
6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Set Up Jenkins

Install Jenkins on a server.
Create a pipeline job for your project.
Configure CI/CD Pipeline

Set up build stages using Jenkins pipeline scripts:
Build the project.
Deploy the WAR file to AWS EC2.
Restart Tomcat.
7. Monitoring and Logging
Set Up AWS CloudWatch

Create log groups and metrics.
Install and configure the CloudWatch agent on your EC2 instance to monitor logs.
Configure AWS CloudTrail

Set up CloudTrail to track API activity and security events.
8. Running the Application
Access the Application

Access your application via http://<EC2-public-IP>:8080/<context-path>.
Verify the application is working as expected.
Monitor Performance

Use CloudWatch dashboards to monitor application performance.
Review logs for any errors or issues.
